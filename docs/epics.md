## ‚úÖ **8. EPIC: Pok√©mon Data Layer (PokeAPI Integration)**

This epic ensures your app has all Pok√©mon data required for:
Team Builder, Pick/Ban, Nuzlocke, and UI displays.

### **User Stories**

| ID      | Story                                                                                                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DATA-01 | As a system, I want to pull species, types, moves, abilities, and items from PokeAPI so the app has valid data. |
| DATA-02 | As a system, I want to cache Pok√©mon data in the database for fast access.                                      |
| DATA-03 | As a player, I want to see move types with color labels so I can recognize danger quickly.                      |
| DATA-04 | As a player, I want autocomplete when searching Pok√©mon, moves, or items.                                       |
| DATA-05 | As a system, I want to expose Pok√©mon data through GraphQL so the frontend doesn‚Äôt hit PokeAPI.                 |

### **BDD Acceptance**

```
Scenario: Cached Pok√©mon data
Given the system has fetched Pok√©mon from PokeAPI
When the team builder queries a Pok√©mon name
Then data is served from the local database
Without calling PokeAPI again
```

```
Scenario: Move type color
Given a move has a type (e.g., Fire)
When it is displayed in the UI
Then it shows the corresponding color palette for that element
```

---

## ‚úÖ **9. EPIC: UI / Design (DS-Style + Navigation)**

This epic controls your **consistent pixel-art UX** across all features.

### **User Stories**

| ID    | Story                                                                                                                |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI-01 | As a user, I want a DS-style UI with pixel borders and buttons so the app feels like a Pok√©mon experience.           |
| UI-02 | As a mobile player, I want a responsive layout so I can play on my phone comfortably.                                |
| UI-03 | As a user, I want a left-side ‚ÄúPok√©mon-style navigation menu‚Äù for fast access (desktop), and a bottom bar on mobile. |
| UI-04 | As a player, I want screens to animate gently (slide/fade) to mimic DS transitions.                                  |
| UI-05 | As any user, I want a dark theme (Gen5 tone) to reduce eye strain.                                                   |
| UI-06 | As a player, I want consistent UI components for lists, tables, badges, and buttons.                                 |
| UI-07 | As a player, I want color-coded type chips in all views (Builder, P&B, Nuzlocke).                                    |

### **BDD Acceptance**

```
Scenario: Mobile-first layout
Given I open the app on a smartphone
When I navigate between tournament screens
Then all layouts and buttons remain visible and usable
Without horizontal scrolling
```

```
Scenario: DS-style consistency
Given I open different screens (Builder, Swiss Standings, Nuzlocke)
Then buttons, tables, fonts, and borders share a unified pixel-art theme
```

## ‚úÖ **10. EPIC: DevOps, Security & Deployment**

This defines how the MVP **runs, updates, and stays secure**.

### **User Stories**

| ID        | Story                                                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DEVOPS-01 | As a developer, I want CI so the app builds and tests on each commit.        |
| DEVOPS-02 | As a maintainer, I want staging & production environments for safe releases. |
| DEVOPS-03 | As a user, I want HTTPS so my data and login are secure.                     |
| DEVOPS-04 | As a developer, I want logs and error tracking to debug failures.            |
| DEVOPS-05 | As a system, I want rate-limiting to prevent abuse on auth routes.           |

### **BDD Acceptance**

```
Scenario: Successful deploy
Given a new update is pushed to main
When CI passes
Then the app builds and deploys to production automatically
```

```
Scenario: Security requirements
Given a user logs in
When credentials are transmitted
Then the connection must use HTTPS
```

**CQRS**

* Commands mutate aggregates, emit domain events.
* Projectors update read models in Mongo (often separate collections optimized for UI).
* Queries read from projections (fast tables: standings, pairings, draft state).

# 5) Swiss Pairing Algorithm (Implementation Notes)

* **Score Groups**: group players by current score.
* **Pair Within Group**: greedy pairing; if odd, ‚Äúfloat‚Äù one to the adjacent group.
* **Avoid Rematches**: maintain `opponents[]` per player; skip pairs already played.
* **BYE**: select from lowest score group among eligible (hasBye=false). Mark `hasBye=true`, grant win points, do not affect OWP negatively (treat as neutral opponent with 0% or exclude from OW%‚Äîchoose and keep consistent).
* **Opponents‚Äô Win % (OWP)**: For each player, average of opponents‚Äô win % (exclude BYE). Recompute after each round closure.
* **Direct Encounter**: if tied and exactly one beat the other, that one ranks higher.
* **Random**: persist a `randKey` at tournament join time for deterministic tie resolution.

---

# 6) Security & Validation

* Use **httpOnly secure cookies** for session/JWT.
* **RBAC decorators** on resolvers: `@Authorized([TOURNAMENT_ADMIN])`.
* **Input validation**: Symfony Validators + FE Zod schemas.
* **Rate limiting**: login, invite, result submit.
* **Anti-cheat** for P&B**: server-side authoritative state; ignore late/invalid actions; all transitions go through command handler; timer stored server-side.

---

# 7) Testing Strategy

* **Unit**: pairing service (edge cases: odd players, rematch avoidance).
* **Integration**: GraphQL mutations for round start, result report update standings.
* **E2E**: Cypress/Playwright for flows: create tournament ‚Üí invite ‚Üí join ‚Üí start round ‚Üí P&B ‚Üí report result ‚Üí standings.

---

# 8) Performance & Caching

* **Catalogs**: preloaded and cached in Mongo; FE caches species/moves/items with SWR.
* **Standings**: projection updated on match result event; O(1) query on UI.
* **Draft**: use subscriptions or short polling (3‚Äì5s) with ETag to reduce load.

---

# 9) Definition of Done (technical)

* GraphQL types have nullability aligned with UI.
* All mutations authorized + validated; errors mapped to UI toasts.
* Read models (standings, pairings, draft) exist and are used by UI; no heavy joins at query-time.
* Dark theme & DS-style components applied to all new pages.

and I‚Äôll send **Message 3/4 ‚Äî UI/UX Mockups (DS-Style), Navigation, and Responsive Rules**, including the **PB-2 + INFO-B** draft screen, Team Builder, Nuzlocke, Standings, and more.


### üé® **MESSAGE 3/4 ‚Äî UI/UX MOCKUPS (DS-STYLE), NAVIGATION, SCREEN-BY-SCREEN, RESPONSIVE RULES**

Mobile-first, DS-style pixel aesthetic (Option A). PB-2 layout with INFO-B (compact tiles + modal for details). This is a **textual mockup spec** you can hand to design/FE directly.

---

# 0) Design System ‚Äî DS-Style Pixel UI

## 0.1 Tokens

* **Font**: ‚ÄúPress Start 2P‚Äù (titles, badges), ‚ÄúInter/Roboto‚Äù (body) ‚Äî fallbacks safe.
* **Base size**: 8px grid. DS look uses chunky 2‚Äì3px borders and 1‚Äì2px inner bevels.
* **Radii**: 0 (squares) and 4px for ‚Äúsoft‚Äù panels only.
* **Borders**: `2px #1B1B1B` outer; inner highlight `1px rgba(255,255,255,0.18)` for bevel; drop-shadow `0 2px 0 #0E0E0E`.
* **Elevation**: Panels stack via double borders (outer dark + inner light).
* **Spacing**: XS=4, S=8, M=12, L=16, XL=24, XXL=32.

## 0.2 Palette (Gen-5 dark vibe)

* **Surface 1**: `#0F1320`
* **Surface 2 (Panel)**: `#171B2E`
* **Surface 3 (Input)**: `#1F2540`
* **Borders**: `#0B0D16`
* **Text Primary**: `#F2F4FF`
* **Text Secondary**: `#9AA2C6`
* **Accent**: `#6AA9FF`
* **Danger**: `#FF5C7A`
* **Success**: `#56E39F`
* **Warning**: `#FFC857`
* **Type chips**: standard Pok√©mon color mapping (Fire `#EE8130`, Water `#6390F0`, Grass `#7AC74C`, ‚Ä¶). Text color automatically `#0B0B0B` or `#FFFFFF` based on contrast.

## 0.3 Components (shared)

* **PixelButton**: sizes S/M/L; default, primary, danger; disabled state reduces contrast by 40%.
* **PixelInput**: inset bevel, caret thick; validation states with left icon.
* **PixelSelect / Autocomplete**: list with type chips on options.
* **BadgeType**: rounded 2px, uppercase type name, auto color.
* **Panel**: header bar (darker strip), body grid; optional footer with actions.
* **Table**: thick header, zebra rows, fixed columns on mobile.
* **Tabs**: big DS tabs with notch highlight.
* **Toast**: slide-up from bottom, DS ping sound optional (toggleable).
* **Modal**: panel with dimmed overlay, pixel corners, focus trap, ESC to close.
* **Timer**: segmented digits `MM:SS` with blinking colon.

## 0.4 Interactions & Animations

* **Page transition**: 150ms slide-in + 100ms fade.
* **Button press**: down-state shifts content by 1px.
* **Focus ring**: 2px `#6AA9FF` outer glow for accessibility.
* **Drag & drop**: pixel ‚Äúghost‚Äù placeholder (dashed border).

## 0.5 Accessibility

* All interactive elements have a11y labels.
* Color contrast AA+.
* Keyboard nav: Tab sequences, Enter/Space, ESC to dismiss modals.
* Live regions for timer warnings (Pick & Ban).

---

# 1) Navigation & IA

* **Builder** (global) ‚Üí create/edit teams.
* **Nuzlocke** (global) ‚Üí runs, encounters, views.
* **Tournament Settings** (admin only).

## 1.2 Nav components

---

# 8) Empty & Error Scenarios (per screen)

* **Standings**: ‚ÄúNo results yet. Finish a round to see rankings.‚Äù
* **Round Pairings**: ‚ÄúRound not started. Admin must press START.‚Äù

---

# 9) Reusability & Theming Notes

* All screens use `Panel` + `Toolbar` + `Table/Grid` pattern.
* Theming via CSS variables: colors, border widths, pixel shadow helpers.
* Support light/dark later by overriding surfaces and text only (types stay same).

---

# 10) Handover Checklist for FE

* [ ] Implement DS tokens as CSS vars.
* [ ] Build core components: Button, Input, Select, Panel, Table, Tabs, BadgeType, Modal, Toast, Timer.
* [ ] Apply mobile layouts first; add desktop enhancements.
* [ ] Respect loading/skeleton states per screen.
* [ ] Ensure a11y and keyboard support on modals/forms.

# 2) MILESTONE DETAILS

---

### ‚úÖ **M1 ‚Äî Core Platform & Auth (Foundation)**

**Objective:** Users can log in and join tournaments.

**Backend**

* Auth (Email + Google)
* JWT or httpOnly cookie session
* CreateTournament / Invite / AcceptInvitation
* Tournament player list queries
* Role guards
* Basic error handling format
* PokeAPI catalog import (baseline: Pok√©mon, types, moves, items, abilities)

**Frontend**

* Login & Register pages
* Google OAuth button
* Tournament creation flow
* Invitation acceptance
* Basic navigation layout (DS-style)
* ‚ÄúMy tournaments‚Äú list
* Skeleton loading states

**Result:**
‚úÖ You can log in, create a Swiss tournament, invite players, and view participant list.

---

### ‚úÖ **M2 ‚Äî Swiss Engine & Match Flow (Play a Swiss tournament)**

**Objective:** Swiss pairing works from R1 ‚Üí Final Standing.

**Backend**

* Swiss pairing algorithm
* BYE rule (lowest score + never twice)
* Round lifecycle (start/close)
* Match creation
* ReportMatchResult + AdminOverride
* Standings projection (OWP ‚Üí Direct ‚Üí Random)

**Frontend**

* Standings UI (desktop + mobile collapse)
* Round Pairings screen
* Match result modal
* Admin round controls (Start / Close)
* BYE display
* Toasts, errors, loading states

**Result:**
‚úÖ Tournaments can be fully played & completed **without Pick & Ban**.

---

### ‚úÖ **M3 ‚Äî Pick & Ban (PB-2) & Team Builder**

**Objective:** BO1 draft + team management integrated into match flow.

**Backend**

* Draft state machine
* SubmitPick / SubmitBan / ConfirmDraft

* Validation against PokeData

**Frontend**

* PB-2 Dual Panel screen (INFO-B modal)
* Timer + log + confirms
* Team Builder UI w/ drag & drop & modals
* Pok√©paste import/export
* Redirect Match ‚Üí P&B before result

**Result:**
‚úÖ Each match now has **Pick/Ban + locked BO1 roster**, then reports result.

---

### ‚úÖ **M4 ‚Äî Nuzlocke System + Polish**

**Objective:** Finalize MVP with full Sheet replacement and UI refinement.

**Backend**

* Nuzlocke mutations/queries
* Encounter storage + status changes
* Coverage service

**Frontend**

* Routes table, Box, Graveyard, Coverage tabs
* Pixel polish on remaining UI
* Error pages, empty states, audio toggle, theme refine

**Result:**
‚úÖ Nuzlocke matches/exceeds spreadsheet usability, and the MVP is feature-complete.

# 3) WEEK-BY-WEEK EXECUTION (RECOMMENDED 6‚Äì8 weeks)

| Week | Focus                                   |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1    | M1 backend + DB + PokeAPI importer      |
| 2    | M1 frontend + auth guard + navigation   |
| 3    | Swiss backend + standings calculations  |
| 4    | Swiss frontend + match reporting        |
| 5    | Pick/Ban backend + Team Builder backend |
| 6    | PB-2 UI + Team Builder UI               |
| 7    | Nuzlocke backend + UI                   |
| 8    | Polish, QA, deployment, bug fixing      |

---

# 4) DEVELOPMENT ORDER (MANDATORY DEPENDENCIES)

```
Auth ‚Üí Tournament Core ‚Üí Swiss Engine ‚Üí Match Flow ‚Üí Team Builder ‚Üí Pick & Ban ‚Üí Nuzlocke ‚Üí Polish
```

Pick & Ban **depends on** Team Builder.
Match flow **depends on** Swiss engine.
Swiss engine **depends on** Tournament Core & Auth.

This order prevents rewrites and keeps morale high (visible progress each milestone).

---

# 5) DEFINITION OF DONE (GLOBAL)

A feature is considered **DONE** when:

‚úÖ Backend:

* Command + Handler + Repository logic implemented
* Unit tests for domain logic (especially Swiss & Draft)
* Query returns correct projection
* Authz + validation errors are clean and typed

‚úÖ Frontend:

* Mobile-first layout, no horizontal scroll
* Loading & error states handled
* Accessible (keyboard + focus-trap for modals)
* Uses shared pixel components
* Toast or inline error on failure

‚úÖ Integration:

* GraphQL mutation tested end-to-end (UI ‚Üí DB)
* Feature persists on refresh
* No console errors

‚úÖ QA:

---

# 6) DEPLOYMENT PLAN

**Environments**

* `dev.local` (Docker + hot reload)
* `staging.domain.com` (auth + seed data)
* `app.domain.com` (prod + backups)

**Infra baseline**

* Caddy/NGINX reverse proxy
* HTTPS (Let‚Äôs Encrypt)
* CI build ‚Üí deploy staging ‚Üí promote to prod
